### Database Name: test_binxrd
Description: The test_binxrd database houses **119,569*2** X-ray diffraction (XRD) simulation spectra in **d-I format**. This dataset serves as a testing dataset, wherein each crystal corresponds to only one spectrum.

We recommend utilizing this **testing dataset (119,569*2 entries)** to compare the predictive capabilities of different models.
