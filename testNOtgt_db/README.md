### Database Name: testNOtgt
Description: The testNOtgt database houses **119,569** X-ray diffraction (XRD) simulation spectra in **d-I format**. This dataset serves as a testing dataset, which lacks a target variable and is randomly ordered. 

**Competition Details:**
- **Dataset:** The competition provides a test dataset without labels (testNOtgt_db). 
- **Objective:** The goal is to accurately identify symmetry groups from the diffraction patterns.
- **Leaderboard:** The leaderboard is designed to fairly compare the performance of different ML models on the symmetry identification tasks, focusing solely on space group identification.
